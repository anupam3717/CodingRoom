## Message from Anupam
College choice is not everything. Your skills are what truly matter. Learn C++/Java, master DSA with 250 important questions, build projects using React/Node.js/Spring Boot, and grasp fundamental computer science concepts like CS, DBMS, SQL, and CN. With these foundations, you'll be ready for successful placements.
